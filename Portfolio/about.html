            <h2>My Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                As a first-semester Information Technology student at NIT Raipur, I have embarked on an exciting journey of learning and exploration.
                My academic pursuits are complemented by hands-on projects in engineering physics, where I have conducted experiments in wave optics,
                gaining practical insights into the behavior of light. Additionally, I have collaborated on video production projects that have honed
                my skills in storytelling, editing, and visual communication. My passion for web development has driven me to create a multi-page
                portfolio website, showcasing my ability to design responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML5. Through these experiences,
                I am continuously developing my technical skills and creative problem-solving abilities, preparing myself for a future in the tech industry.
